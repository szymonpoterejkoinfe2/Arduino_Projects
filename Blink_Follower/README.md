Blink Follower is my first Arduino project, consisting of a simple circuit and software. The primary function of the device is to replicate the number of diode blinks inputted by the user.

The program counts the number of button clicks until the second "follower" button is pressed. Upon initialization, the program blinks the diode as many times as the "light up" button was clicked and then resets the counter. If the "follower" button is activated without prior clicks on the "light up" button, the circuit illuminates the diode five times with a very short break between blinks.
